"""Build a corpus: python3 -m corpora <target> [args]

    all          every lane, downloaded and generated - start here
    expand       turn generated .bin into the text files training reads
    fetch        any Hugging Face dataset, by name
    reasoning    OpenThoughts deliberation traces
    pg19         the PG19 test split, for a comparable bits-per-byte
    persona      a persona dialog export, as its own lane; not in `all`

    code         Python from the local filesystem   -> data_char
    arithmetic   synthesised, with scratchpads      -> data_math_char
    chat         primal chat and self-knowledge     -> data_chat_char
    chess        Lichess games in algebraic         -> data_chess_char

The four generators write train.bin, val.bin and meta.json into a data_*
directory: plain uint16 character streams, tied to no model, so a corpus
outlives any particular architecture. `expand` turns those into the text
files under data/ that `train.py read` actually opens - it skips .bin.

`all` runs the whole thing, in order, and is the only one most people need.
