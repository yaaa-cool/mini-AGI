"""
Build a conversational corpus for mini-AGI.

The models so far have seen Python source and arithmetic and nothing else, so
they cannot hold a conversation at all - not because of the interface, but
because they have never seen a dialogue turn.

Rather than download instruction data of unknown relevance, most of this is
mined from the code already on the machine: a function's docstring is an
instruction and its body is the response, which is real instruction-following
data grounded in what the model was actually trained on. Arithmetic questions
are phrased naturally over the same generator as math_data. A small hand-written
seed covers greetings, capability questions and refusals, because none of that
exists in stdlib source.
