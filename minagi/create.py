"""
Write a fresh weights directory: one file per expert, nothing trained yet.

The directory IS the model, so starting from scratch means writing the
directory rather than initialising an object and hoping something saves it
later. Every expert file holds its weights beside a pair of zeroed Adam
moments, which is what the paged pool expects to find when it loads one.

This used to be a script in tools/, which meant a checkout without tools/
could not create a model at all, and the documented first step was a file
that might not be there. Training calls `create` itself now when it is
pointed at a directory that does not exist, so there is no first step.

Every default comes from config.yaml. Nothing here decides model shape.
