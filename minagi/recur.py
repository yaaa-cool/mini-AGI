"""Latent recurrence with adaptive depth.

The same blocks are applied repeatedly to a hidden state that is never decoded,
so a small number of distinct blocks becomes a much larger number of block
applications. Each character decides for itself how many passes it needs
(PonderNet-style halting) and stops when another pass would not change the
answer.

    n_prelude + max_steps * (n_recur + n_coda)   block applications
    n_prelude + n_recur + n_coda                 distinct blocks

`RecurConfig.n_layer_effective` is the authority on that arithmetic; anything
that quotes it should read it rather than recompute it.
