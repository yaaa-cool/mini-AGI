"""
A pool larger than the card it runs on.

The claim this exists to make true: disk holds every expert, RAM caches the
ones recently wanted, and VRAM holds only the ones being worked with now. Three
tiers, and only the last is scarce.

WHICH EXPERTS ARE ON THE CARD is decided by one rule, and it is the router's:

    The text chooses. Every character ranks the WHOLE pool with the router
    and asks for its top_k, each request carrying the probability the router
    gave it, and every forward's first pass adds its characters' requests to
    the vote of its text - everything read since position 0. A forward may
    use at most `resident` different experts: it is admitted the ones its
    text has voted for most, until the card is full. Every character routes
    among the admitted experts, so one whose request was not admitted takes
    its best admitted expert instead.

A training window is a text of its own, so its experts are the most
requested of its first pass. A reply is a text that grows one character at a
time: each character is a forward of its own, and routes among the experts
the prompt and the reply so far have voted for - the same choice a window
over that text would make, cut off at the character being written. A single
character never chooses for itself; training never asks it to.

How the choosing is done has a temperature, pool.select_temperature, which
is about experts and never about the text - characters are always chosen
greedily. At 0 the card is the text's most-voted and every character takes
its top 8. Above 0 both are drawn: at each row 8 experts are drawn from the
text's probabilities until the card is full (_draw), and every character
draws its 8 from its own, in proportion to p^(1/T).

Left alone the router keeps choosing the same experts, so the WHOLE POOL is
kept in use by a balance term in the loss (pool.balance): every forward that
trains charges the router for the probability it puts on each expert, in
proportion to that expert's share of recent admissions. It changes the router
itself, so reading and writing choose the way training does - see
note_balance. Whatever admits an expert resets its prune clock: being used is
being alive.

A forward is whatever the model computes at once - a training window, a chunk
of held-out file, a prompt, and then each character of the reply. What is
computed depends only on the text and the weights; what happened to be on the
card before only decides how many experts have to be loaded - and because a
text's vote moves slowly, a reply loads a new expert only now and then.

The cap is not arbitrary. Everything a forward used must still be on the card
for its backward and for the optimiser step, and an expert on the card for
training costs its weights, their gradient and Adam's two moments. A forward
with no backward after it - a held-out chunk, a character being written -
needs its experts only while it runs, so the next forward is free to choose
again.

WHAT MAKES PAGING HARD is not the weights. It is the optimiser. Adam keeps two
moments per parameter, and those belong to the EXPERT, not to the slot of VRAM
it happens to occupy. Stepping an expert with the moments its slot held for the
expert before it would hand it a stranger's momentum - the model would keep
training, and every paged expert would be steered by someone else's history.
So every expert on the card is stepped with its own moments, and the optimiser
is told about the slots rather than about the experts.

Only a step reads them, so they travel only to a step: an expert comes to the
card with its weights alone, and just before each optimiser step
(_own_moments) every expert on the card that is not already holding its own
moments gets them from its entry in RAM or on disk. A reply loads experts at
almost every character and steps none of them, so writing moves no moments at
all; parking an expert that was stepped carries its moments back with its
weights.

        Before every optimiser step: each expert on the card holds its own
        moments, and one that does not yet gets them now.

        AdamW steps every slot, used or not, so every expert on the card at a
        step is stepped, and it must be stepped with its own history. An
        arriving expert brought only its weights, so its moments are copied in
        here from its entry in RAM or on disk - the latest it has, because
        nothing has stepped it since it was loaded. From then until another
        expert takes the slot, the step keeps them its own.

        Moments filled into tensors the optimiser has since replaced are
        nobody's: a restore from optim.npz writes the slot-indexed moments of
        whichever experts sat in the slots when it was saved, so after one
        every slot is filled again. Before an optimiser's first step there
        are no moment tensors to fill; Adam creates them, at zero, in it.

        Write k new experts to disk and make them part of the pool.

        They are not loaded. A new expert only reaches VRAM if a forward admits
        it. Growth is therefore cheap in a way it never was while every expert
        had to be resident: adding a hundred experts costs a hundred files and
        not one megabyte of card.

        HOW ONE IS BUILT is RECOMBINATION, by default from `recombine` other
        experts. A hidden unit is the triple (w1[u], w3[u], w2[:, u]) and units
        are interchangeable, so a child assembled from whole units taken from
        different parents keeps every unit's learned feature intact while
        computing a function nothing in the pool computes.

        The two obvious alternatives both fail, in opposite directions. A clone
        plus noise is not novel - its output sits at ~0.98 cosine to its parent
        where two established experts sit at ~0.04 - so it only double-counts
        what the pool already has. A fresh random expert is novel but computes
        nothing worth routing to. What works is novelty built from TRAINED
        parts. The comparison is in `runs/results/birth_schemes.json`.

        A new expert is born at `birth_gate`, a small starting scale rather
        than a verdict: prune reads staleness, not the gate, so what keeps a
        newborn alive is its trial window and then being asked for.

        ITS ROUTER ROW IS ITS PARENTS'. Every router gains a row per newborn,
        and that row is the average of the rows of the experts its units came
        from, weighted by how many units each gave. A row is what decides
        whether any text ever asks for the expert, and a random one is asked
        for by chance or not at all: this one is asked for where its parents
        are, which is where its units already know what to do.

        it has not been admitted to the card once in THE LAST `survival` steps,
        and it is never touched at all in its first `survival` steps.

          stale    a trailing window, not a one-off check at birth: an expert
                   that worked for 200,000 steps and has since gone quiet dies
                   too. Age earns nothing permanent. Not "its gate is low",
                   not "its gate stopped rising" - it was not chosen.

        THERE IS NO GATE TERM HERE, deliberately. The gate is not merely
        uninformative about whether an expert will be wanted again, it is
        anti-predictive: the smallest gates belong to the busiest experts. One

        nothing has asked for in hundreds of thousands of texts reads as
        alive. A gate test would delete the first and spare the second.

        The growth brake reads the SAME staleness, through dying(): an expert
        is dying once it has gone `dying_at` of the way to this window without
        being addressed. One definition, two thresholds - one that stops
        growth, one that deletes.

        A newborn is safe for `survival` steps no matter what, so it cannot be
        judged before texts have had the chance to ask for it.
