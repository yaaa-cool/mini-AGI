"""
One way of moving text through the model, used for training and for serving.

Here there is one primitive, `read`. It walks a character stream, keeps a KV
cache, and consumes the stream a chunk at a time. With `learn=True` each chunk
takes a gradient step; with `learn=False` nothing is updated. Both cost the
same, because both keep the same cache and the same length of graph.

Two knobs, and they are independent:

    CHUNK     how much text is inside one autograd graph. This sets the peak
              activation cost and nothing else. It is not a batch: the chunks
              are consecutive, and the cache carries between them.

    CONTEXT   how far back attention reaches. This sets the cache size, which
              is linear in context and cheap - about 0.107 MB per character
              across every cache slot the depth uses.

Because the graph is bounded by CHUNK rather than by CONTEXT, context is nearly
free to extend. That is what makes the trade worth making: batch 1 gives up
gradient averaging and buys back an order of magnitude of context.

What does NOT cross a chunk boundary is gradient. The cache carries the model's
view of everything it has read; backpropagation reaches only to the start of
the current chunk. The model can attend to something 30,000 characters back and
cannot learn a weight update through it. That is the cost of the design, and it
is stated here rather than discovered later.

    Grow the window over the run instead of jumping to it.

    The model attends with RoPE, which has no learned parameters, so a longer
    context costs nothing to represent - but the model has only been trained at
    the lengths it has seen, and loss degrades well beyond them. Extending
    gradually keeps it near a length it can already handle while it learns the
    next one.

    GRADUALLY MEANS GRADUALLY. Rounding the window to powers of two turns this
    into a staircase, and a window that doubles in one step is a shock the run
    may not recover from - loss and gradient norm both jump, and the clip stops
    being able to hold it. Nothing here needs a power of two: the cache and the
    rotary tables take any length, so `granularity` keeps each change small.
