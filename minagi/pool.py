"""
A shared, self-growing expert pool with no assigned specialities.

One pool, every domain in one mixture, no labels anywhere. Soft top-k routing
distributes capability across experts by itself, and a character can combine
fragments from several. The cost is real and worth stating: capabilities share
parameters, so they CAN interfere. What holds forgetting off is the trunk
learning rate, kept at a fraction of the experts' (`training.trunk_lr_mult`) -
not the pool, and not replay. Measured, not assumed: see `runs/cl/`.

Because it is not provable, it is made falsifiable instead. `superposition()`
asks whether each domain lights up a disjoint set of experts (specialisation -
the design failed) or whether domains share experts heavily (superposition -
the design worked).

GROWTH WITHOUT INTERVENTION
`maybe_grow()` runs inside the training loop. Nobody decides "now add chess".
The pool grows when it is saturated - every expert carrying load and routing
entropy near maximum - and NOT merely when the loss is flat, because a plateau
with idle experts means the optimiser is stuck, not that the model is full.
New experts arrive gated to almost zero and are pruned away if they never contribute.

        Remove experts that were grown and never contributed.

        `survival` is the window, and is the name every caller uses because
        PagedPool.prune takes it. It means the same thing here that `min_age`
        always did - how long an expert gets before it is judged - and it is
        accepted so that a caller does not have to know which pool it holds.

        THE TEST DIFFERS FROM PagedPool'S, and deliberately. There, an expert
        that is not resident does not train, so its gate cannot move and a
        gate test would condemn exactly the experts being starved of the card;
        residency is the only honest signal. Here there is no card. Every
        expert is resident and trains on every step, so the reverse holds -
        see below.

        Contribution is read off the GATE, not off routing traffic. Routing
        traffic cannot answer this question: the load-balancing auxiliary loss
        pushes utilisation toward uniform on purpose, so every expert - live or
        dead - receives roughly its 1/n share and no `use` threshold can ever
        separate them. The gate is under no such pressure. It is trained only
        by whether the expert helps, and a new expert starts at exactly zero,
        so a gate still at zero after a fair number of steps is the model
        saying it found no use for that expert.

        Two conditions guard against pruning something that is still learning:
        the expert must be old enough in TRAINING STEPS, and its |gate| must
        not have climbed measurably since the last check. A gate that is tiny
        but rising is working its way in and is left alone.

        `protect` keeps the first N experts (the ones the pool started with)
        out of pruning entirely - they carry the trunk's learned capability and
        are not speculative additions.

    Let the pool find its own size by trying, not by reading its own statistics.

    Growth is speculative and regular: add a few experts, gated near zero so
    nothing already working is damaged, and let pruning remove the ones that
    never contribute. The pool ratchets toward the size the data needs, and the
    cost of guessing wrong is a few experts that get deleted again.

    The mechanism, in the order it runs:

      Every `growth.every_chars` characters the reader asks this class whether
      to grow. It adds `growth.k` experts if all of these hold, and otherwise
      says in one line which one refused:

        ROOM    the pool is under its disk ceiling and VRAM is not nearly
                spent. An expert file is ~25 MB with its Adam moments, so the
                disk ceiling is what decides how large the model may ever get.

        USED    the capacity already added is being asked for. Measured on
                STALENESS, never on routing share: the load-balancing loss
                forces routing toward uniform on purpose, so every expert -
                live or dead - receives roughly its 1/n share and a
                routing-based idle count reports zero forever.

        KEPT    the previous cohort survived its trial. Counted from `born`,
                so it names the experts it is about.

        FITS    no more than `growth.max_in_flight` experts are inside their
                trial at once. Neither usage brake can see a newborn, so
                without this cap there is a whole trial window in which
                nothing can refuse.

      A fifth condition lives in the reader, because the pool cannot see it
      from the inside: whether train and held-out have separated, which is what
      memorising looks like. See `growth.max_gap`.

      A new expert is born at a small gate - `growth.birth_gate` - with its
      parents' router rows averaged, so it scores every character with the
      same average of their scores. It is on TRIAL for
      `prune.survival_chars`, during which prune cannot touch it; at the end
      of the trial prune deletes it unless it is still being admitted. The
      gate scales what it contributes, never whether it is asked for.
