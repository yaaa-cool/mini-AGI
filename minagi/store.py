"""
The weights directory IS the model.

Everything the model works with is a separate file. There is no monolithic
checkpoint; this directory is what training reads at the start of a session,
what it writes at every evaluation, and what inference loads from.

    weights/
      manifest.json          what exists, its shape, and where it came from
      core.npz               embeddings, attention, norms, halting head
      routers.npz            one entry per call site - which experts it reaches
      optim.npz              Adam moments for the trunk and the routers
      experts/               one file per expert: w1, w3, w2 and that
        e00000.npz           expert's own Adam moments
        e00001.npz
        ...

Only the experts are split out, because an expert is the unit that gets paged,
grown and pruned - a new expert really is a new file. Everything else is always
resident together and gains nothing from being separate, so it is bundled.

When the model grows an expert, a new file appears in experts/. When it prunes
one, that file is deleted. `ls weights/experts | wc -l` is the parameter count
in the most literal sense available.

Writes are atomic: every file is written to a .tmp and renamed, so an
interrupted save cannot leave a half-written weight behind.
