"""
A chat window for talking to the model.

    python3 serve.py                 then open http://127.0.0.1:8080

Nothing but the conversation. Generation streams a character at a time, so
what you watch is the model writing rather than a spinner followed by a wall
of text - at this size that difference is most of the information.

Decoding is greedy and deterministic: the same conversation gives the same
reply twice. The loops greedy decoding falls into are held off by the
adaptation trace in minagi/decode.py, at the strength config.yaml sets.

IT LEARNS WHILE YOU TALK TO IT, and this CHANGES THE WEIGHTS ON DISK. The
exchange joins one continuous stream and the model takes an optimiser step
every `training.chunk` characters of it - the same path minagi/stream.py
takes through a corpus, which is why there is no second mechanism to reason
about. Read minagi/live.py for what it costs; it is not free, and on short
chat it is a far denser diet than documents. `--no-learn` serves read-only.

Binds to localhost.

    Corpus text to open the conversation with, or "" if there is none.

    TWO THINGS IT BUYS, and they are separate. The reply has context to stand
    on: "hi" alone is two characters, and every character the model writes
    attends over what came before it and routes among the experts that whole
    context has voted for. And the learning stream starts part-way to its
    first step rather than twenty exchanges short of one.

    Taken from the self-knowledge lane because it is already in the register
    the chat is in - <user>/<bot> turns about what the model is - so this is
    text the model has read, not a preamble invented here and trained on.
    The `self-` files are the short question-and-answer ones; `auto-src-` are
    whole source files quoted back, and priming with one of those biases the
    router toward code and teaches the model to open by dumping a module.

    CUT WHERE THE MARKERS BALANCE, not at the last closing tag. This corpus
    documents its own format, so a file contains a code block reading
    "<bot>   </bot>" as prose - and those are real marker tokens, not
    spellings. Trimming to the last </bot> landed inside that block and
    returned a passage with an unclosed turn in it, which hands the model an
    open <bot> to answer inside before the conversation has started.

    Deterministic: the first file that yields a usable passage, every time. A
    passage picked at random would make the same conversation give different
    answers across restarts, and repeating a reply is worth more than variety.
