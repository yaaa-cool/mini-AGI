Training mini-AGI.

    read      point it at files and let it read them, continually. This is the
              one that matters, and the one the run uses.

    stream    the same mechanism over a packed corpus: batch 1, a KV cache,
              one chunk of characters at a time. Peak memory is set by
              --chunk and nothing else, so --context is nearly free to extend.

    probe     what depth the model chooses, per character.

Everything here runs at batch 1 behind a cache. The fixed-window regime that
preceded it - several windows per step, one autograd graph over each whole
window - cost about three times as much at an eighth of the reach: 6857 MB at
4k characters against 3090 MB at 32k, because the retained activation graph
was bounded by the window rather than by the chunk.

                text here that can be reasoned from about the MODEL.

    own. Where they diverge is exactly where it is falling into a hole - a
    signal that was invisible while only the guarded text was kept.

    Nothing draws a random number, and not for reproducibility: CUDA does not
    give that anyway. Temperature would make the text look better by rolling
    dice against the model's own prediction, which is a different thing from
    the model being right. The repeat rate on the RAW reading is the number to
    drive down, and only a better model can drive it.
